What is Stacked
Stacked is a Flutter Framework for building Production Applications. It is a complete frontend architecture for Flutter. The framework is created to build scalable, testable and maintainable code for a single developer or a team of developers.

Checkout the [official docs] (https://stacked.filledstacks.com/) for more information.

## Branching
The project works in two branch
    1. Main - branch for live and production app
    2. Develop - this where you will checkout branches for adding / modifying features, then once PR passed, the branch will be merge to develop. Testing app builds will be generate in this branch.

## Running the project
The app relies on some generated scripts and files so it is needed to run this command before running the application:
- flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
